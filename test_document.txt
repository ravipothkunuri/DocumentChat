# Test Document for RAG System

## Introduction
This is a test document to demonstrate the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system functionality. 
The document contains various sections with different types of information.

## Features
The RAG system includes:
- Document upload and processing
- PDF, TXT, and DOCX support
- Vector embeddings generation
- Semantic search capabilities
- LLM-powered question answering
- Streamlit-based user interface

## Technical Details
The system uses:
- FastAPI for the backend API
- Streamlit for the frontend
- LangChain for RAG pipeline
- Ollama for local LLM inference
- Scikit-learn for vector similarity

## Sample Data
Here are some sample facts:
1. The sky is blue during the day
2. Water freezes at 0°C (32°F)
3. Python is a programming language
4. Machine learning is a subset of AI
5. The Earth orbits around the Sun

## Conclusion
This test document helps verify that the document processing, chunking, and retrieval systems are working correctly.
